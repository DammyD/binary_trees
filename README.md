# General
- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
# What is a Binary Tree?
Binay Tree: is a special data structure that is used for data storage purpose. A tree that has a node and at least two childern, it ahs the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.

# Important Terms
Following are the important terms with respect to tree.

- Path − Path refers to the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.

- Root − The node at the top of the tree is called root. There is only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.

- Parent − Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.

- Child − The node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.

- Leaf − The node which does not have any child node is called the leaf node.

- Subtree − Subtree represents the descendants of a node.

- Visiting − Visiting refers to checking the value of a node when control is on the node.

- Traversing − Traversing means passing through nodes in a specific order.

- Levels − Level of a node represents the generation of a node. If the root node is at level 0, then its next child node is at level 1, its grandchild is at level 2, and so on.

- keys − Key represents a value of a node based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node.

# Binary search Tree
A Binary Search Tree has a special behavior. A node's left child must have a value less than its parent's value and the node's right child must have a value greater than its parent value
